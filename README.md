## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ghoshal12345/url-shortener.git
cd url-shortener
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is running on your local machine:

## 🔧 Configuration

### Port Configuration
The application runs on port `8005` by default. You can change this in `index.js`:

```javascript
const PORT = 8005;
```

### Database Configuration
MongoDB connection string is set in `index.js`:

```javascript
connectDB("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/short-url-practice");
```

## 📖 Usage

### 1. Create an Account
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8005/signup`
- Enter your name, email, and password
- Click "Sign Up"

### 2. Sign In
- Go to `http://localhost:8005/signin`
- Enter your credentials
- Click "Sign In"

### 3. Shorten a URL
- After signing in, you'll be redirected to the home page
- Enter a full URL (e.g., `https://www.example.com`)
- Click "Generate Short URL"
- Your shortened URL will be displayed

### 4. Use the Short URL
- Click on the shortened URL or copy it
- Share it anywhere
- When accessed, it will redirect to the original URL

### 5. View Your URLs
- All your created short URLs are displayed on the home page
- Only you can see your own URLs (privacy protected)

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User signs up with name, email, and password
2. User signs in with email and password
3. A session ID is generated using UUID
4. Session is stored in a Map with user details
5. Session ID is sent as a cookie to the browser
6. Middleware checks authentication on protected routes
7. Only authenticated users can create short URLs

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### User Schema
```javascript
{
  name: String (required),
  email: String (required, unique),
  password: String (required)
}
```

### URL Schema
```javascript
{
  shortId: String (required, unique),
  redirectUrl: String (required),
  createdBy: ObjectId (reference to User),
  timestamps: true
}
```

## 🌟 Key Features Explained

### URL Generation
- Uses `nanoid` to generate unique 8-character short IDs
- Automatically adds `http://` if protocol is missing
- Stores the creator's user ID for privacy

### Session Management
- Uses in-memory Map for session storage
- Session ID stored in cookies
- Automatic authentication check on protected routes

### Privacy
- Each user can only see their own shortened URLs
- URLs are filtered by `createdBy` field in database queries

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- Gradient purple background (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Smooth hover animations
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Modern card-based layout
- Clear visual feedback for user actions
- Emoji icons for better visual appeal

## 🔒 Security Considerations

**Note:** This is a learning project. For production use, consider:

- Hash passwords using bcrypt
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement JWT for better session management
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use HTTPS in production
- Add CSRF protection
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use Redis or database for session storage instead of in-memory Map
